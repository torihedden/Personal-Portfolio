  <!--The better method of getting HTML to be able to talk to the JS.
      Put it in the BODY, not HEAD. Put after the script. Put at the bottom, as the last thing in the body
      tag.-->

  <!-- How do you make JavaScript and HTML work together? Put script in the body. But it slows down the site.
        If you put the script down at the bottom, the JS will load last. You should do this. You want all
        other content to load first, before the JavaScript.-->
